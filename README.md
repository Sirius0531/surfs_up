# Temperature Trends in Oahu, Hawaii

** Overview of the statistical analysis:**

The purpose of our analysis is to check the temperature conditions in the area and measure whether the surfing and activity shop business can start operations.
We take temperature data in June and December for statistics. Get two separate query results. After running the query, we store the temperatures in a list and then convert them into graphs and summary statistics afterward.

** Results: **
